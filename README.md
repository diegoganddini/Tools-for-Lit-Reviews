This is a simple code to retrieve data from semantic scholar. You need an API key from semantic scholar to make it work. You can request it here: https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key
Remember that this is Python code. You can edit the code to retrieve the data you need. For a complete list of all the retrievable data check this site: https://api.semanticscholar.org/api-docs/graph#tag/Paper-Data/operation/post_graph_get_papers
